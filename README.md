## Required Software

  (https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
  (https://multiworld.gg/downloads/)

## Setup Guide

- Download SL_ArchipelagoSRB2_Vxxx.pk3 and srb2.apworld from releases (https://github.com/GraymonDgt/SRB2Archipelago/releases)

- Install srb2.apworld by opening it or moving it to either

C:\ProgramData\Archipelago\custom_worlds\ or C:\ProgramData\MultiworldGG\custom_worlds\ .

## Joining a Multiworld Game

- After opening the Archipelago/MultiworldGG client, there will be an option labeled "Sonic Robo Blast 2 Client".

- When opening that, a dialogue will open asking for your SRB2 directory, select the same folder as srb2win.exe/gamedata.dat.

- After connecting using the server address and port number, SRB2 will automatically open with the AP mod loaded.

# FAQ

- How do I set up an Archipelago game?
  
  This guide should hopefully help you get started:
  https://github.com/GraymonDgt/SRB2Archipelago/blob/main/srb2/docs/detailed_guide_en.md

- Do modded characters work?
  
  While you can use modded characters, logic doesn't currently account for them and there's no way to switch to them in the hub.
  If you want to use a modded character with no logic issues, select 'All' for your starting character in the yaml settings.

- Do modded level packs work?

  No

- The AP mod didn't load when connecting.

  You can load the AP mod manually and everything will work fine.

- Something something can't read APTranslator.dat.
  
  I swear I'm working on fixing that, keep restarting the client until it works.

- SRB2 was closed, do I have to restart the client?

  No, you can reopen SRB2 and reload the AP mod without any issues.
