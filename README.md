# SRB2APClient
The APworld, client, and mod files to be used with Archipelago randomizer

Avoid mentioning/ linking this on the main AP Discord because of the "no fangames" rule.
All discussion/ development of this APworld will take place here:
https://discord.gg/kkH4wBUmG9

If you don't already have the standalone Archipelago client installed, download it from here:
https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago


# SETUP GUIDE

(Assuming you already know what Archipelago is and how to set up a game)

Download srb2 here: https://www.srb2.org/download/

Put SL_ArchipelagoSRB2_Vxxx.pk3 in the addons folder

Install the srb2 apworld

There will be a new client in the archipelago launcher named "Sonic Robo Blast 2 Client"

When opening that, a dialogue will open asking for your SRB2 directory (the same folder as srb2win.exe/gamedata.dat)

Connect to archipelago and SRB2 will automatically open with the AP mod loaded

# FAQ

- How do I set up an Archipelago game?
  This guide should hopefully help you get started:
  https://github.com/GraymonDgt/SRB2Archipelago/blob/main/srb2/docs/detailed_guide_en.md

- Do modded characters work?
  While you can use modded characters, logic doesn't currently account for them and there's no way to switch to them in the hub.
  If you want to use a modded character with no logic issues, select 'All' for your starting character in the yaml settings.

- Something something can't read APTranslator.dat
  I swear I'm working on fixing that, keep restarting the client until it works


# ADDITIONAL NOTES

type "hub" into the console to return to the hub at any time

If the AP mod didn't load, you can load it yourself and everything will work fine

You can relaunch SRB2 if the game closes as long as it is in the same folder you picked when launching Archipelago

Contact me in the #sonic-robo-blast-2 channel in the discord above if you run into any issues
