# SRB2APClient
The APworld, client, and mod files to be used with Archipelago randomizer

Avoid mentioning/ linking this on the main AP Discord because of the "no fangames" rule.
All discussion/ development of this APworld will take place here:
https://discord.gg/kkH4wBUmG9

# SETUP GUIDE

Download srb2 here: https://www.srb2.org/download/

Put ArchipelagoSRB2.pk3 in the addons folder

Install the srb2 apworld

There will be a new client in the archipelago launcher named "Sonic Robo Blast 2 Client"

When opening that, a dialogue will open asking for your SRB2 directory (the same folder as srb2win.exe)

Connect to archipelago and srb2 will automatically open with the AP mod loaded



# ADDITIONAL NOTES

IF YOU USE autoexec.cfg BACK IT UP BEFORE LOADING THE AP CLIENT, IT WILL BE CLEARED UPON JOINING

Make sure to delete the file 'apgamedat.dat' before connecting if you have played a different AP game with SRB2 before

If the AP mod didn't load, you can load it yourself and everything will work fine

You can relaunch SRB2 if the game closes as long as it is in the same folder you picked when launching Archipelago
