# SRB2APClient
The APworld, client, and mod files to be used with Archipelago randomizer

Avoid mentioning/ linking this on the main AP Discord because of the "no fangames" rule.
All discussion/ development of this APworld will take place here:
https://discord.gg/kkH4wBUmG9

If you don't already have the standalone Archipelago client installed, download it from here:
https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago


# SETUP GUIDE

Download srb2 here: https://www.srb2.org/download/

Put SL_ArchipelagoSRB2_Vxxx.pk3 in the addons folder

Install the srb2 apworld

There will be a new client in the archipelago launcher named "Sonic Robo Blast 2 Client"

When opening that, a dialogue will open asking for your SRB2 directory (the same folder as srb2win.exe)

Connect to archipelago and SRB2 will automatically open with the AP mod loaded



# ADDITIONAL NOTES

If you don't already know how to set up an Archipelago game, follow this guide:

https://github.com/GraymonDgt/SRB2Archipelago/blob/main/srb2/docs/detailed_guide_en.md

type "hub" into the console to return to the hub at any time

If the AP mod didn't load, you can load it yourself and everything will work fine

You can relaunch SRB2 if the game closes as long as it is in the same folder you picked when launching Archipelago
